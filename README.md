# Arushi Marwaha's Portfolio
### About
Hey there! I'm Arushi Marwaha, diving into the fascinating world of Mathematics at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research in Thiruvanthampuram, Kerala. Back at Panjab University, I found my groove with a Bachelor's degree in Physics (Honours), landing the 8th spot in the overall Physics Honours course.

During a research stint at the Indian Statistical Institute-Delhi, I got hands-on with Linear Algebra and Matrix Analysis under the mentorship of the incredible Dr. Tanvi Jain. As a Course Hero tutor, I had a blast supporting folks in various subjects, earning a thumbs-up for my efforts and even tackling advanced topics like AI and Probability.

Right now, I'm knee-deep in a Python-based image recognition project, where fractal dimension meets Convolutional Neural Networks. Alongside, I play my part in the academic scene as a Class Representative and National Service Scheme Volunteer, fostering a spirit of collaboration. Tech-wise, I'm your go-to person for Python, SQL, R-Programming, and more, with certifications in SQL, Data Visualization, and Python.

Beyond all that, I'm not just seeking opportunities—I'm welcoming them with open arms! Eager to continue this journey of learning and exploration in the ever-evolving realms of mathematics and data science. Let's connect and make something awesome happen!

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Hospitality Project
**Code:** [`Hospitality Project`](https://github.com/ArushiMarwaha/Hospitality_Project_PowerBi)

**Goal:** AtliQ Grands seeks to revive market share and revenue in luxury/business hotels by leveraging data analytics for strategic insights. They've enlisted a third-party service for analyzing historical data amid declining performance and competition.

**Description:** Guided by industry experts, the project addressed challenges of declining market share and revenue in luxury hotels. My role was crucial in providing strategic insights to Atliq Grands' Revenue Team

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis,,Data Modelling and data visualization

**Technology:** Power Bi (Business Intelligence Tool),Power Query Editor,DAX Language

**Results:** Mumbai leads in revenue at 669M, followed by Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Delhi. AtliQ Exotica excels with 320M revenue, a 3.62 rating, 57% occupancy, and a 24.4% cancellation rate. Week 24 records the highest revenue at 139.6M. Delhi dominates in both occupancy and rating, while AtliQ faces a substantial 298M loss due to cancellations. Elite rooms, though highly booked, experience a higher cancellation rate.
