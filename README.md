# Arushi Marwaha's Portfolio
### About
Hey there! I'm Arushi Marwaha, diving into the fascinating world of Mathematics at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research in Thiruvanthampuram, Kerala. Back at Panjab University, I found my groove with a Bachelor's degree in Physics (Honours), landing the 8th spot in the overall Physics Honours course.

During a research stint at the Indian Statistical Institute-Delhi, I got hands-on with Linear Algebra and Matrix Analysis under the mentorship of the incredible Dr. Tanvi Jain. As a Course Hero tutor, I had a blast supporting folks in various subjects, earning a thumbs-up for my efforts and even tackling advanced topics like AI and Probability.

Right now, I'm knee-deep in a Python-based image recognition project, where fractal dimension meets Convolutional Neural Networks. Alongside, I play my part in the academic scene as a Class Representative and National Service Scheme Volunteer, fostering a spirit of collaboration. Tech-wise, I'm your go-to person for Python, SQL, R-Programming, and more, with certifications in SQL, Data Visualization, and Python.

Beyond all that, I'm not just seeking opportunitiesâ€”I'm welcoming them with open arms! Eager to continue this journey of learning and exploration in the ever-evolving realms of mathematics and data science. Let's connect and make something awesome happen!

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Hospitality Project
**Code:** [`Hospitality Project`](https://github.com/ArushiMarwaha/Hospitality_Project_PowerBi)

**Goal:** AtliQ Grands seeks to revive market share and revenue in luxury/business hotels by leveraging data analytics for strategic insights. They've enlisted a third-party service for analyzing historical data amid declining performance and competition.

**Description:** Guided by industry experts, the project addressed challenges of declining market share and revenue in luxury hotels. My role was crucial in providing strategic insights to Atliq Grands' Revenue Team

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis,,Data Modelling and data visualization

**Technology:** Power Bi (Business Intelligence Tool),Power Query Editor,DAX Language

**Results:** Mumbai leads in revenue at 669M, followed by Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Delhi. AtliQ Exotica excels with 320M revenue, a 3.62 rating, 57% occupancy, and a 24.4% cancellation rate. Week 24 records the highest revenue at 139.6M. Delhi dominates in both occupancy and rating, while AtliQ faces a substantial 298M loss due to cancellations. Elite rooms, though highly booked, experience a higher cancellation rate.

### Market Basket Analysis with Machine Learning using Python
**Code:** [`Sales Analysis Project`](https://github.com/ArushiMarwaha/Market_Basket_Analysis_in_Python/tree/main)

**Goal:** Conduct comprehensive market basket analysis on the Grocery dataset using sophisticated association rule mining algorithms, particularly Apriori, to unearth meaningful relationships between products and extract valuable insights.

**Description:**"Market Basket Analysis" serves as a valuable technique in the realm of data mining and machine learning, aiming to unveil correlations or associations between items frequently purchased together by customers. Its primary goal is to provide businesses with insights into customer purchasing behavior, enabling the identification of patterns that can be strategically harnessed for purposes such as targeted product recommendations, cross-selling initiatives, and the optimization of store layouts.

At the core of executing Market Basket Analysis lies the renowned "Apriori algorithm." Widely acclaimed, this algorithm operates through a meticulous two-step process. Firstly, it identifies frequent itemsets within a transaction dataset, and secondly, it generates association rules based on these findings. This sophisticated approach equips businesses with a nuanced understanding of customer-product interactions, facilitating well-informed decision-making by leveraging the discovered patterns.

**Skills:** Exploratory Data Analysis,Data Mining,Machine learning and data visualization

**Technology:** Python, Google colab

**Results:** Implementing the generated association rules has enabled us to strategically enhance various aspects of our retail operations. By optimizing product placement, implementing cross-selling strategies, and tailoring promotions based on identified patterns, we have successfully elevated the shopping experience for customers. This data-driven approach has not only increased customer engagement but has also translated into a significant boost in sales, showcasing the tangible impact of informed retail strategies on our overall business performance.

### Page View Time Series Visualizer
**Code:** [`Time Series Visualizer`](https://github.com/ArushiMarwaha/Time-Series-Visualizer)

**Goal:** The primary goal of this project is to visualize time series data using various chart types, including line charts, bar charts, and box plots. Leveraging Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the objective is to analyze and illustrate the number of daily page views on the freeCodeCamp.org forum from May 9, 2016, to December 3, 2019. The visualizations aim to uncover patterns in visitor behavior and identify trends in yearly and monthly growth.

**Description:** In the initial phases, the project entails the adept use of Pandas for importing data from the designated "fcc-forum-pageviews.csv" file, with a subsequent focus on data refinement. This involves meticulous cleaning processes, excluding days where page views fall within the extreme 2.5% tails of the dataset. The subsequent stages unfold through the orchestration of distinctive functions. The draw_line_plot function, fueled by Matplotlib, meticulously crafts a line chart reminiscent of "examples/Figure_1.png," crowned with the title "Daily freeCodeCamp Forum Page Views 5/2016-12/2019." The x-axis elegantly traces the timeline with the label "Date," while the y-axis portrays the essence of the data through the label "Page Views."

The narrative deepens with the introduction of the draw_bar_plot function, an artisanal creation for shaping a bar chart akin to "examples/Figure_2.png." This visualization encapsulates the average daily page views per month, intricately grouped by year. A legend, bedecked with month labels, adorns the chart under the title "Months." Meanwhile, the x-axis gracefully unfolds the passage of time, labeled as "Years," while the y-axis quantifies the essence in terms of "Average Page Views."

The grand finale unfolds with the draw_box_plot function, a magnum opus in Seaborn, orchestrating the symphony of two adjacent box plots akin to "examples/Figure_3.png." The first, titled "Year-wise Box Plot (Trend)," paints a vivid picture of the data distribution within each year. Its counterpart, "Month-wise Box Plot (Seasonality)," unravels the intricacies of data distribution over time, starting each year from January. In both, meticulous attention ensures accurate labeling of the x and y axes.

**Skills:** Exploratory Data Analysis,data cleaning, analysis, modeling, and data visualization

**Technology:** Python, Google colab

**Results:** As the project unfolds, it aspires to deliver not just visualizations but a narrative that unravels the intricate fabric of freeCodeCamp.org forum page views. The results are poised to offer nuanced insights into visitor behavior.
